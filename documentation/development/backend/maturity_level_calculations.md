# Maturity Level calculations

The following questions and responses implement the [Essential Eight Maturity Model](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/essential-eight-maturity-model). The model defines [eight essential baseline strategies](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/essential-eight-explained) to reduce expose to cyber security incidents.

Mitigation Strategies to Prevent Malware Delivery and Execution:

1. Application control
2. Patch applications
3. Configure Microsoft Office macro settings
4. User application hardening

Mitigation Strategies to Limit the Extent of Cyber Security Incidents:

5. Restrict administrative privileges
6. Patch operating systems
7. Multi-factor authentication
8. Daily backups

The model defines three maturity levels that can be applied to each ASD mitigation strategy:

Maturity Level 1: Organisation is partly aligned with the ASD mitigation strategy.<br>
Maturity Level 2: Organisation is mostly aligned with the ASD mitigation strategy. <br>
Maturity Level 1: Organisation is fully aligned with the ASD mitigation strategy.

We have added a precursor level:

Maturity Level 0: Organisation is no aligned with the ASD mitigation strategy.

### Implementation notes

The following document specified the core questions for each mitigation strategy, and available responses. The questions and responses for each mitigation strategy are mapped on a flowchart, indicating where decision points are for maturity level assignments.

This was then expressed as a sequence of pseudo-logic assignment rules.

_An assignment of a level terminates the calculation, but it does not necessarily terminate the questionnaire._
