we can take advantage when producing content for presenting our product.
Please feel free to update this list more alternatives, it is recommended that only software that
is available across Windows, Mac and Linux should be listed here.

This content will be avalible on Microsoft Teams in the following location

An introduction to Lightworks and Handbreak will be uploaded onto Microsoft Teams in the following folder (alongside this document).

The functionality demonstrated in Lightroom is similar across different video editing software.

Lightroom may not be the best option available due to its limitations when exporting content from the free version.
