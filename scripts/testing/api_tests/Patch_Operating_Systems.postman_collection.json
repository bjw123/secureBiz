Having a testing environment will also protect the companyâs assets.\",\"QuestionNumber\":65,\"QuestionSetNumber\":6,\"QuestionCore\":false,\"Answers\":[{\"_id\":\"601bafa3abe3cc7b086d8170\",\"Value\":false,\"Label\":\"No\",\"QuestionNext\":66,\"QuestionNextCore\":null}],\"__v\":0},{\"_id\":\"601bafa3abe3cc7b086d8171\",\"QuestionCategory\":\"PatchOS\",\"QuestionLabel\":\"Do you have change management procedure to oversee, review and approve all significant IT changes?\",\"QuestionDescription\":\"\",\"QuestionType\":\"BOOLEAN\",\"Mitigation\":\"All IT changes that are to be made should be carefully considered before its integration with the organizations system(s). All risks and benefits should be addressed and weighed, and all IT changes should be thoroughly tested in an external testing environment to ensure it does not compromise the organizations security.

A good rollback plan will allow the corrupted or âbrokenâ system to return to a functioning state to limit the damage that can occur if an update corrupts the system. The rollback plan should outline a step-by-step process that will allow the company to recover and restore the system in its entirety back to working functionality.\",\"QuestionNumber\":67,\"QuestionSetNumber\":8,\"QuestionCore\":false,\"Answers\":[{\"_id\":\"601bafa3abe3cc7b086d8175\",\"Value\":true,\"Label\":\"Yes\",\"QuestionNext\":68,\"QuestionNextCore\":null}],\"__v\":0},{\"_id\":\"601bafa3abe3cc7b086d8177\",\"QuestionCategory\":\"PatchOS\",\"QuestionLabel\":\"Do you perform any form of Vulnerability Assessment or Penetration test on new systems and applications introduced to your network environment?\",\"QuestionDescription\":\"\",\"QuestionType\":\"BOOLEAN\",\"Mitigation\":\"All new systems, applications and patch updates should be thoroughly tested and assessed before it is integrated with the organizations current system(s). A systematic review should be completed to evaluate current known vulnerabilities of the new applications, and a thorough penetration test should also be completed in case vulnerabilities exist that are yet to be documented.\",\"QuestionNumber\":68,\"QuestionSetNumber\":9,\"QuestionCore\":false,\"Answers\":[{\"_id\":\"601bafa3abe3cc7b086d8178\",\"Value\":true,\"Label\":\"Yes\",\"QuestionNext\":69,\"QuestionNextCore\":null}],\"__v\":0},{\"_id\":\"601bafa3abe3cc7b086d817a\",\"QuestionCategory\":\"PatchOS\",\"QuestionLabel\":\"Have you or a vendor completed assessment of operating systems installed on all workstations?\",\"QuestionDescription\":\"\",\"QuestionType\":\"BOOLEAN\",\"Mitigation\":\"It is important to have an in-depth, updated summary or assessment list of all the current operating systems installed across the workstations of the organization. This is part of security risk assessment and should be completed regularly to provide an insight of the possible risks that exist to the operating systems used by the company. It also provides an overview of the current versions of operating systems being used, which can be useful when implementing security functionalities.\",\"QuestionNumber\":69,\"QuestionSetNumber\":10,\"QuestionCore\":false,\"Answers\":[{\"_id\":\"601bafa3abe3cc7b086d817c\",\"Value\":false,\"Label\":\"No\",\"QuestionNext\":70,\"QuestionNextCore\":null}],\"__v\":0},{\"_id\":\"601bafa3abe3cc7b086d817d\",\"QuestionCategory\":\"PatchOS\",\"QuestionLabel\":\"Do you have a regular, scheduled security maintenance?\",\"QuestionDescription\":\"\",\"QuestionType\":\"BOOLEAN\",\"Mitigation\":\"Scheduling security maintenance periods is an important consideration when it comes to properly maintaining the organizations systems. Having a well-structured security schedule will minimize the impacts maintenance has on the vital operations of the company.

It will also enable uniformity across the organization, ensuring no device is left behind in terms of patches and updates. Another added benefit is time management, as the ability to centralize updates that work across the organization will save a significant amount of time that would otherwise be spent individually updating each system.\",\"QuestionType\":\"BOOLEAN\",\"Mitigation\":\"\",\"QuestionNumber\":71,\"QuestionSetNumber\":12,\"QuestionCore\":false,\"Answers\":[{\"_id\":\"601bafa3abe3cc7b086d8181\",\"Value\":true,\"Label\":\"Yes\",\"QuestionNext\":72,\"QuestionNextCore\":null}],\"__v\":0},{\"_id\":\"601bafa3abe3cc7b086d8183\",\"QuestionCategory\":\"PatchOS\",\"QuestionLabel\":\"Do you have an application (automated or not) to scan your system to identify required patches?\",\"QuestionDescription\":\"\",\"QuestionType\":\"BOOLEAN\",\"Mitigation\":\"The organization should deploy an application that can thoroughly scan active systems, and regularly searches for new or missing updates and patches.
